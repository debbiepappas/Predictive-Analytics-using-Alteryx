### <span style="color:red">Given:</span>
**Dataset of 85 data points (rows) representing stores from California and predictive variables (columns) representing percentage sales per category such as dairy, deli, bakery, etc.**

### <span style="color:red">Objective:</span>
**Forecast the total produce sales of the 85 existing stores and 10 new stores by performing the following:**

1. The clustering diagnostics tool was used on all predictive variables
    to separate the existing stores into clusters.
2. Decision Tree, Forest Model, and Boosted Model were used to predict the store format (cluster number) for the new stores.
3. The ETS time series forecasting model was used to forecast the total produce sales for the new and existing stores.

### <span style="color:red">Result:</span>
**The forecast of the total produce sales for the new stores was lower than the existing stores.**
